# Instructions
In our UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt.

- For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
- Create three buttons, one for each selection.
    - Add an event listener to the buttons that calls your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
- Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
- Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
- Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
- You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of the programmer’s life.
- Once you’re all done with your UI and make sure everything’s satisfactory, it’s time to merge our current branch rps-ui to our main branch.
